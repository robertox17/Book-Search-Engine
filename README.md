## Google-Books-Search App
Welcome to the Google Books Search app! This app allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their searches to the back end. It was built using the MERN stack (React, MongoDB, Node.js/Express.js) and has been refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
